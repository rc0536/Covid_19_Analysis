# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
## Project Structure
The SQL queries provided in this repository are designed to extract and analyze data across different dimensions to understand the impact and progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis covers total cases, deaths, infection rates, death rates, vaccination totals, and vaccination rates among different populations.
## Features
### Total Cases and Death Analysis
**State Level Data:** Analyzing total cases and deaths to calculate the death percentage.
**Country Level Data:** Highest death count and infection rates compared to the population.
### Global Analysis
**Daily Global Numbers:** Aggregates new cases and deaths globally, computing the overall death percentage.
**Total Global Numbers:** Summarization of global cases and deaths.
### Vaccination Analysis
**Population vs. Vaccination:** Evaluates the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.
**Vaccination Rollout:** Tracking the rolling count of people vaccinated.
### Visualizations
**Database Views:** For easier access and visualization, views are created to continuously track vaccination percentages and compare them against the total population.
